<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

```
This corrected code uses the `via` color property to specify an intermediate color ensuring a smooth transition between `from` and `to`. It's important to ensure that the chosen colors are compatible for a seamless gradient effect.  Checking Tailwind's color palette documentation can help to select compatible color values.
