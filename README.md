# Tailwind CSS Gradient Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where color incompatibility or misconfiguration can lead to unexpected visual results. 

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains code that uses a linear gradient.  If the `to` color is incompatible, or if there's a typo, the gradient might not render as expected, possibly appearing blank or with the wrong colors.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve this issue by carefully choosing compatible colors and ensuring correct syntax.
