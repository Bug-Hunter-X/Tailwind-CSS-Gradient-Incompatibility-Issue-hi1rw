```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  However, if the `to` color is not specified correctly or is incompatible with the `from` color, it might result in unexpected visual results, such as a blank or incorrectly colored background.
